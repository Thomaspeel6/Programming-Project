1. **Valid Maze File**: Load a valid maze file containing walls, paths, start ('S'), and exit ('E') points. Ensure the maze loads correctly without any errors.

2. **Invalid Maze File**: Load an invalid maze file, such as one with incorrect characters or dimensions. Verify that the game handles the error gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

3. **Player Movement**: Move the player character ('X') through the maze using WASD keys. Ensure the player can move freely through paths (' ') but cannot move through walls ('#') or off the edge of the map. Test movement in all directions (up, down, left, right).

4. **View Map ('M'/'m')**: Test the functionality to view the map ('M'/'m'). Ensure that the map is displayed correctly with the player's current location marked by an 'X'.

5. **Player Reaches Exit**: Navigate the player character to the exit point ('E') of the maze. Verify that the game ends when the player reaches the exit and displays a message indicating that they have won.

6. **Player Attempts Illegal Moves**: Test scenarios where the player attempts to move through walls or off the edge of the map. Ensure that the game prevents illegal moves and provides appropriate feedback to the player.

7. **Maze Edge Cases**: Test with mazes of different dimensions, including the minimum and maximum allowed dimensions (5x5 and 100x100). Ensure that the game handles these edge cases correctly.

8. **Multiple Mazes**: Test loading and navigating multiple different maze files. Ensure that the game can handle switching between different mazes seamlessly.

9. **Performance Testing**: Test the game's performance with large mazes, including those close to the maximum allowed dimensions. Verify that the game remains responsive and playable without significant lag.

10. **Boundary Testing**: Test boundary conditions such as moving the player to the edges of the maze or trying to move beyond the boundaries. Ensure that the game behaves correctly in these scenarios without crashing or displaying unexpected behavior.
